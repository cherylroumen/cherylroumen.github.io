The grant Topspecialist Care and Research enables the structural connection between radiotherapy care, research and education by which excellent care is made sustainable. Maastro treats patients with cancer according to state-of-the art treatments. This is possible because of our costefficient way of working as well as due to external funding for our innovative technologies, processes and infrastructure. This grant consists of four parts: an integral vision and three research projects. In our vision we ensure that our innovations follow an innovation circle in which health-innovation-knowledge generation-creating value are interconnected. These innovations will will form the basis of (inter)national guidelines and structural imrpovements in the health care system. This grant will lead to artificial intelligence-based predction models, supporting treatment choicesfor both photon as well as protontherapy. These choices involve side effects that have a high impact on the quality of life such as heart failure (project 1), loss of cognition (project 2) and loss of bowel function (project 3).
