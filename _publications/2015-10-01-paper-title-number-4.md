BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Study on Lifestyle intervention and Impaired glucose  tolerance Maastricht (SLIM), a randomized controlled trial, directed at diet and  physical activity in impaired glucose tolerant subjects was effective to improve  glucose tolerance and prevent type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to  determine the effects of the SLIM lifestyle intervention on the incidence and  prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) during the active intervention and four  years thereafter. METHODS AND RESULTS: MetS was diagnosed according to the NCEP ATP  III criteria. At baseline, 66.4% of all participants (n = 146, age 57 ± 7 years, BMI  29.7 ± 3.6, 51.3% female) fulfilled the criteria for MetS. No significant difference  in MetS prevalence was observed between the intervention (63.9%) and control group  (68.9%). At the end of active intervention (average duration 4.2 ± 2.0 years),  prevalence of MetS was significantly lower in the intervention group (52.6%, n = 57)  compared to the control group (74.6%, n = 59) (p = 0.014). Furthermore, in  participants without MetS at baseline, cumulative incidence of MetS was 18.2% in the  intervention group at the end of active intervention, compared to 73.7% in the  control group (Log-rank test, p = 0.011). Four years after stopping active  intervention, the reduced incidence of MetS was maintained (Log-rank test, p =  0.002). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a combined diet-and-exercise intervention to  improve glucose tolerance, not only prevented type 2 diabetes, but also reduced the  prevalence of MetS and prevented MetS development, showing the long-term impact of  lifestyle intervention on cardiovascular risk reduction.
