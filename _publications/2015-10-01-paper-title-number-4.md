BACKGROUND: Patient decision aids (PDAs) can support the treatment decision making  process and empower patients to take a proactive role in their treatment pathway  while using a shared decision-making (SDM) approach making participatory medicine  possible. The aim of this study was to develop a PDA for prostate cancer that is  accurate and user-friendly. METHODS: We followed a user-centered design process  consisting of five rounds of semi-structured interviews and usability surveys with  topics such as informational/decisional needs of users and requirements for PDAs.  Our user-base consisted of 8 urologists, 4 radiation oncologists, 2 oncology nurses,  8 general practitioners, 19 former prostate cancer patients, 4 usability experts and  11 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Informational needs for patients centered on three  key factors: treatment experience, post-treatment quality of life, and the impact of  side effects. Patients and clinicians valued a PDA that presents balanced  information on these factors through simple understandable language and visual aids.  Usability questionnaires revealed that patients were more satisfied overall with the  PDA than clinicians; however, both groups had concerns that the PDA might lengthen  consultation times (42 and 41%, respectively). The PDA is accessible on  http://beslissamen.nl/ . CONCLUSIONS: User-centered design provided valuable  insights into PDA requirements but challenges in integrating diverse perspectives as  clinicians focus on clinical outcomes while patients also consider quality of life.  Nevertheless, it is crucial to involve a broad base of clinical users in order to  better understand the decision-making process and to develop a PDA that is accurate,  usable, and acceptable.
