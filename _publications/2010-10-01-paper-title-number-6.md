BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: AIMS: To determine the effect of a lifestyle intervention on serum transferrin and  ferritin levels and the relationship between changes in transferrin and ferritin and  changes in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. METHODS: Randomized controlled  lifestyle intervention directed at a healthy diet and increased physical activity in  subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. RESULTS: After 1 year, the change in  ferritin levels in the intervention group as compared with the control group did not  reach statistical significance (P = 0.06). Transferrin change was independently  related to the change in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and  ferritin change was related to the change in 2-h free fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS:  Changes in insulin sensitivity and postprandial lipid metabolism are related to  changes in iron metabolism.
