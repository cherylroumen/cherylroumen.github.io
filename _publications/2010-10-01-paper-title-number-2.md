BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a 4.1-year (range 3-6 years)  lifestyle intervention according to general public health recommendations on glucose  tolerance and dropout in a Dutch population with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).  SUBJECTS/METHODS: In the Study on Lifestyle intervention and Impaired glucose  tolerance Maastricht, 147 Caucasian IGT subjects were randomized to an intervention  group (INT: n=74; 38 male, 36 female) and control group (CON: n=73; 37 male, 36  female). Annually, subjects underwent measurements of body weight, anthropometry,  glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), insulin resistance (homeostasis  model assessment-insulin resistance), maximal aerobic capacity (VO(2) max), blood  lipids and blood pressure. INT received individual advice regarding a healthy diet  and physical activity. RESULTS: INT decreased their saturated fat intake, increased  their carbohydrate intake (P<0.05) and VO(2) max (P=0.04) compared with CON. Body  weight did not change significantly (P=0.20) between the groups. After an initial  decrease, 2-h glucose levels overall increased in INT (+0.11 mmol/l), but  significantly less than CON (+1.18 mmol/l; P=0.04). Diabetes incidence was lower in  INT versus CON (30 versus 56%, P=0.04). Change in body weight was associated with  change in 2-h glucose levels (β=0.399 mmol/l per kg, P=0.02). Dropouts had a lower  aerobic fitness and socioeconomic status, and a higher body mass index (BMI) and 2-h  glucose compared with non-dropouts. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged feasible changes in diet  and physical activity prevent deterioration of glucose tolerance and reduce diabetes  risk. Low socioeconomic status, low aerobic fitness and high BMI and 2-h glucose are  indicative of dropout to the program.
