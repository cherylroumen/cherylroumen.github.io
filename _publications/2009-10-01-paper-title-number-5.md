OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a 3-year diet and exercise lifestyle  intervention, based on general public health recommendations, on glucose tolerance,  insulin resistance and metabolic cardiovascular risk factors in Dutch subjects with  impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled  lifestyle intervention over 3 years. A total of 147 IGT subjects (75 male, 72  female) were randomized to the intervention (INT) group or control (CON) group; 106  subjects (52 INT, 54 CON) completed 3 years of intervention. Annually, glucose,  insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were determined fasting and after  an oral glucose tolerance test. Measurements of body weight, serum lipids, blood  pressure and maximal aerobic capacity were also performed. RESULTS: Analysis of  those who completed the 3-year trial, showed that the lifestyle intervention  improved body weight (INT -1.08 +/- 4.30 kg; CON +0.16 +/- 4.91 kg, P = 0.01),  homeostatis model assessment index for insulin resistance and 2-h FFA. Two-hour  glucose concentrations improved in the INT group, the difference being most  pronounced after 1 year, with a return to baseline values after 3 years, from 8.59  +/- 1.55 to 8.55 +/- 0.34 mm; in contrast, 2-h glucose deteriorated in the CON  group-from 8.46 +/- 1.84 to 9.35 +/- 2.50 mm (P = 0.02). In the INT group, diabetes  incidence was reduced by 58% (P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Our lifestyle intervention  showed a sustained beneficial effect on 2-h glucose concentrations, insulin  resistance and 2-h FFA, even after 3 years. Our lifestyle intervention is effective,  but for implementation more information is needed about factors influencing  adherence.
